Welcome to my website! My research explores the key role of language in various interpersonal, intercultural, health, and mediated contexts. I have used a variety of research methods such as experimental design, corpus analysis, content analysis, and computerized text analysis. My research has been funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China and Merck Pharmaceutical.


Language and Social Influence
-----

This line of research examines the persuasive effects of language features such as markers of agency, facework, and metadiscourse. Drawing on theories from linguistics and communication studies, I seek to understand how these strategic word choices help to promote prosocial behaviors in interpersonal and health contexts. My work has been published at [_Applied Linguistics_](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_2022_AL.pdf) and [_Health Communication_](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Zhang_Jia_McGlone_HC.pdf).

Chinese Socio-pragmatics
-----

This line of research examines the Chinese pragmatic behaviors from various perspectives such as (im)politeness, metapragmatics, gestures, and discourse markers. I aim to critically understand the how Chinese pragmatics research can contribute to the international community. My works have been published at [_Lingua_](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_Yang_2021_Lingua.pdf) and [_Text & Talk_](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_Yao_2022_TT.pdf).


Computational Approaches to Text and Discourse
-----

This line of research employs various computational methods to understand language and communication in and outside of academia. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, a recent study examines how dissertation writers communicate gratitude in their dissertation acknowledgements across different disciplines.
