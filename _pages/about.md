Welcome to my website! My research explores the key role of language in various interpersonal, intercultural, health, and mediated contexts. I use methods such as experimental design, corpus analysis, content analysis, and computerized text analysis. My research has been funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China and Merck Pharmaceutical.


Language and the Communication of Wisdom
-----

Language is a primary means of passing one's wisdom to others in the forms of advice, vlogs, and books. This line of research examines the linguistic features of wisdom communication and their effects on the recipients. Some of the linguistic features I have studied include linguistic agency assignment, linguistic politeness, and metadiscourse markers. My work has been published at [_Applied Linguistics_](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_2022_AL.pdf) and [_Health Communication_](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Zhang_Jia_McGlone_HC.pdf).

Chinese Socio-Pragmatics
-----

This line of research examines the Chinese pragmatic behaviors from various perspectives such as (im)politeness, metapragmatics, gestures, and discourse markers. I aim to critically understand how Chinese data help to theorize language use across cultures. My work has been published at [_Lingua_](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_Yang_2021_Lingua.pdf) and [_Text & Talk_](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_Yao_2022_TT.pdf).


Computational Approaches to Text and Discourse
-----

This line of research employs various computational methods to understand language and communication in and outside of academia. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, a recent study examines how dissertation writers communicate gratitude in their dissertation acknowledgements across different disciplines.
