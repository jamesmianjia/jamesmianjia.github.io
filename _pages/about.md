Welcome to my website! I am currently a PhD Candidate in Communication Studies at The University of Texas at Austin. My research explores the communicative effects of subtle language features (e.g., markers of agency, metadiscourse, politeness) on people's perceptions and behaviors. I teach classes on intercultural communication, interpersonal communication, linguistic pragmatics, and professional communication. My research has been funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China and Merck Pharmaceutical.

Language and Social Influence
======

This line of research seeks to understand the persuasive effects of language features in various interpersonal and health communication contexts. I draw on theories from linguistics and communication studies. My representative publications are listed as follows:

* Zhang, T. Z., Jia, M., & McGlone, M. S. (2022). Combating antibiotic resistance via linguistic agency assignment. Health Communication. Online First Publication. https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2022.2147125
* Jia, M. (2022). Toward an integrated understanding of language and health communication: Discourse-analytic and message design approaches. Applied  Linguistics, 43(6), 1217–1221. https://doi.org/10.1093/applin/amac063

Linguistic (Im)politeness
======

This line of research seeks to understand the communicative effects of linguistic (im)politeness expressions across different contexts. I use both qualitative and quantitative methods such as discourse analysis, content analysis, corpus analysis, and experimental design. My representative publications are listed as follows:

* Jia, M. & Yao, S. (2022). ‘Yo I am Superman, You Kiddo Go Home’: Ritual impoliteness in Chinese freestyle rap battles. Text & Talk, 42(5), 691–711. https://doi.org/10.1515/text-2020-0097
* Jia, M. & Yang, G. (2021). Emancipating Chinese (im)politeness research: Looking back and looking forward. _Lingua_, _251_, 103028 [Editors' Choice Article]. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lingua.2020.103028
