Welcome to my website! My research explores the key role of language in various interpersonal, intercultural, health, and online contexts. To better understand these language processes, I use a variety of research methods such as experimental design, corpus analysis, content analysis, computerized text analysis, and multimodal conversation analysis. My research has been funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China and Merck Pharmaceutical.


Language and Social Action
-----

This line of research examines the communicative effects of language features such as markers of agency, metadiscourse, and (im)politeness. Drawing on theories from linguistics and communication studies, I seek to understand how people use language to achieve various instrumental, relational, and identity goals in interpersonal and health communication contexts. Some of the contexts I have explored include advice-giving, health messaging strategies, and acknowledgments writing. My representative works are published at [_Applied Linguistics_](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_2022_AL.pdf), [_English Today_](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_An_ET.pdf), and [_Health Communication_](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Zhang_Jia_McGlone_HC.pdf).

Culture and Linguistic (Im)politeness
-----

This line of research explores the linguistic realizations of (im)politeness across various Chinese communicative contexts, especially those that are underrepresented or misrepresented. I aim to understand the stability and variability of culture in linguistic communication and in turn develop theories that are applicable in across linguacultures. My representative works are published at [_Lingua_](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_Yang_2021_Lingua.pdf) and [_Text & Talk_](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_Yao_2022_TT.pdf).
