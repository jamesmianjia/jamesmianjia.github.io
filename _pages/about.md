Welcome to my website! My research explores the key role of language in various interpersonal, intercultural, health, and mediated contexts. I use methods such as experimental design, corpus analysis, content analysis, and computerized text analysis. My research has been funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China and Merck Pharmaceutical.

Language and Persuasive Health Message Design
-----

Using discourse-analytic and experimental message design approaches, my first line of research explores the role of language in facilitating effective communication of health information and promoting wellness. My current projects examine the persuasive effects of linguistic and normative message influence strategies on raising people's awareness of health issues in multilingual societies and across different languacultures. Some of the health contexts I have studied include educational fact sheets about antibiotic stewardship, public signs about COVID-19 prevention, and reminders on signing up for HPV vaccination. My work has been published in _Applied Linguistics_ ([2022](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_2022_AL.pdf)), _Health Communication_ ([2023](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Zhang_Jia_McGlone_HC.pdf)), and _Pragmatics and Society_ ([2023](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_Zhao_2023_PS.pdf)).


Language and Interpersonal Communication
-----

Drawing on insights from linguistic pragmatics and communication studies, my second line of research examines how interlocutors use linguistic (im)politeness and other metadiscourse markers to communicate social support and social influence in various interpersonal and intercultural contexts. My current projects examine how a strategic choice of these subtle linguistic features shapes recipients' perceptions, intentions, and behaviors in face-to-face and mediated contexts. Some of the face-sensitive contexts I have studied include giving advice, responding to compliments, managing trolling, and performing ritual insults. My work has been published in _Lingua_ ([2021](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_Yang_2021_Lingua.pdf)) and _Text & Talk_ ([2022](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_Yao_2022_TT.pdf)).
