Welcome to my website! I explore how subtle language features shape people's decision-making in various interpersonal, intercultural, health, and mediated contexts. I use methods such as experimental design, corpus analysis, content analysis, and computerized text analysis. My research has been funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China, the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong, and Merck Pharmaceutical.

Language and Persuasive Health Message Design
-----

Using discourse-analytic and experimental message design approaches, my first line of research examines the persuasive effects of linguistic and normative message influence strategies on raising people's awareness of health issues in multilingual societies and across different languacultures. My current projects focus on using multiple messaging strategies to promote HPV vaccination and reduce alcohol consumption intentions.

Language and Interpersonal Influence
-----

Drawing on insights from linguistic pragmatics and communication studies, my second line of research examines how interlocutors use linguistic (im)politeness and other metadiscourse markers to communicate social support and social influence in various interpersonal and intercultural contexts. My current projects examine how a strategic choice of these subtle linguistic features shapes recipients' attitudes and behaviors in face-to-face and mediated contexts.
