Welcome to my website! My research explores the key role of language in various interpersonal, intercultural, health, and mediated contexts. I use methods such as experimental design, corpus analysis, content analysis, and computerized text analysis. My research has been funded by the National Social Science Foundation of China and Merck Pharmaceutical.


Language and Interpersonal Communication
-----

Language is a fundamental means of communicating social influence and social support. Focusing on (im)politeness and metadiscourse, I examine how people conceptualize and use these markers differentially and how a strategic choice between these subtle linguistic features shape people's perceptions, intentions, and behaviors. My work has been published in _Lingua_ ([2021](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_Yang_2021_Lingua.pdf)) and _Text & Talk_ ([2022](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_Yao_2022_TT.pdf)).

Language and Persuasive Health Message Design
-----

Adopting a message design approach, this line of research explores how subtle language features shape people's evaluation of a health problem and their intentions to follow the health recommendations. Some of the health communicative contexts I have examined include antibiotic resistance, COVID-19, vaccinations for HPV and Pneumonia. My work has been published in _Applied Linguistics_ ([2022](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_2022_AL.pdf)), _Health Communication_ ([Online First](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Zhang_Jia_McGlone_HC.pdf)), and _Pragmatics and Society_ (2023).


Computational Approaches to Text and Discourse
-----

This line of research employs various computational methods to understand language and communication in and outside of academia. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, my recent publication examines how dissertation writers communicate gratitude in their dissertation acknowledgements across different disciplines. This paper has been published in _English Today_ ([Online First](https://jamesmianjia.github.io/files/Jia_An_ET.pdf)).
